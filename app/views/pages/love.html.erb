<h1>We have a few recommendations to take the suckiness out of your day.</h1>

While I was in recovery, I came across a lot of different books and things that helped me figure out my life and get things back on track.  Here are a few that I love in particular.<br><br>

<div class="center"><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1278342&c=ib&aff=287680&cl=200773" target="ejejcsingle"><%= image_tag "bundle2.jpg" %></a>
<br><br><br>Spirited and the Spirited Companion are two books about fear, dreams, self-sabotage, comparison, and more.  Spirited is part storytelling and part workbook, while the companion gives you a monthly guide on how to deal with your demons head-on.  Beautifully designed and full of wisdom.  <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1278342&c=ib&aff=287680&cl=200773" target="ejejcsingle">Click here to learn more.</a></div><br><br>

This can seriously change your life.  Because really, when do you ever think about how you feel as being the end result you want?  You probably don't.  But the truth is, you set goals in life <em>because</em> you want to feel a certain way, whether that's happy or successful or whatever, but if you start with the feeling, you'll realize that maybe happiness is already in front of you.  <a href="http://www.daniellelaporte.com/shop/desire-map-ebook-bonus/?dlap=23251">Click here to learn more.</a></div>
