<h1>Depression and anxiety aren't the boss around here.</h1>

Let's be real. Having a mental illness sucks. I know because I was severely depressed for a long time and ended up droppping out of college because of it. I spent a lot of time meditating, contemplating the meaning of existence, and staring at my belly button before I figured out that a lot of the resources out there meant to help depression and anxiety didn't actually help me - but I did discover a few things that did. 

Thus I started creating my Depression Toolbox, first as just a file on my computer listing different things to do if I was feeling bad. But it expanded over time and eventually it was what I turned to for any depressive or anxious mood and instantly felt better. There was nothing I couldn't overcome now, and it certainly wasn't because of the "traditional" methods of treating mental illness. Then I realized I could help a lot of people if I shared what I did to overcome my 9 year depression. So that's what we do. Help you learn how to love life again.
