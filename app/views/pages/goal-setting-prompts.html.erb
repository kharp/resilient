I must confess: I LOVE setting goals.  Love it.  I could set goals all day long.<br><br>

For fun, sometimes I plan out different parts of my life and dream about the future and I absolutely love it.  Of course, I try to live in the present, but thinking about the future can certainly be fun and motivating.<br><br>

I decided to put together this list of questions and prompts for setting goals because it’s a compilation of the various tools, books, and videos I’ve used in my own life to plan out the year (but you can start at any time!).<br><br>

So, grab a journal or new blog post (I used the <a href="https://dailygreatness.refersion.com/c/748b7">Daily Greatness journal</a>) and a cup of tea and let’s get started!  Feel free to pick and choose the questions you want to answer.  You don’t have to answer everything; these are just here to give you ideas and get your mind in dreaming and planning mode.<br><br>

What do you want in life?<br><br>

<strong>Different areas of your life-</strong> first score each area from 1-10 (1 being awful and 10 being everything is amazing!) and set goals for each.<br><br>

Family and Friends<br>
Love<br>
Social and Fun<br>
Money<br>
Health and Body<br>
School or Career<br>
Spirituality and Personal Growth<br><br>

List 5 things you believe.<br>
List 5 things that are important to you.<br>
List your 5 most important values.<br><br>

Write about what you accomplished in the last year.<br>
Write down your favorite memories from the past year.<br>
Write about what you are grateful for in the past year.<br><br>

List 10 things you hope to accomplish in the next year (or 12, one per month!).<br><br>

1 year goals<br>
10 year goals<br>
Lifetime goals<br><br>

In order to accomplish these new goals, what are you going to have to change in your life?  How can you create new habits that will propel you forward?<br><br>

Daily habits<br>
Weekly habits<br>
Monthly habits<br><br>

Every day, write down your three most important tasks and then do them.  If you do this every day, you’ll make a ton of progress.<br><br>

///<br><br>

<strong>Figuring out your passion and purpose...</strong><br><br>

What could you talk about for hours?<br>
What do you do when you procrastinate?<br>
What are people always asking you about?<br>
What would you do if you retired?<br>
 Why were you put on this earth?<br> 
What is your bigger than big dream?<br><br>
 
So now that you’ve dug deep and answered all these questions, look back at your answers and find what keeps coming up.  Circle common themes.<br><br>
 
Based on your previous answers, what is your gift that you want to share with the world?<br> 
How do you want to change the world?<br>
What legacy do you want to leave?<br><br>

Create a mission statement for your life.  Here’s mine:<br><br>

<em>Life purpose: to bring light to the darkness, and hope to the hopeless.  To be an influential female tech entrepreneur.  To love much and live simply.  To leave the world better than I found it.</em><br><br>

If you had $100 million in the bank, what would you do with your life?<br>
If you knew you were guaranteed to succeed, what would you do?<br>
What did you love to do as a child?<br><br>
