							<h1><strong>Can an app really make you happy?</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">
								Well, no.  Here's the thing: happiness is an inside job.  So no app, hot boyfriend (or girlfriend), chocolate cake, new iPhone, big house, six figure job, nice car, or six pack abs are ever going to give you long-lasting happiness.  That's because happiness doesn't come from external validation, it comes from YOU.<br><br>

								Now you might be wondering what the point of making a mental health app is if it's not going to make you happy.  The point is to get you to see that happiness is a choice.  The point is to point you in the right direction so you can discover the truth for yourself, because right now you probably don't want to believe me.  That's because society has people conditioned to believe that happiness can be yours for a low price of $19.95 (but wait, there's more!).<br><br>

								The point is to make things easier on you because there really are things you can do that make depression and anxiety a lot easier (and plus, <em>choosing</em> to be happy isn't as simple as POOF, now I'm happy and all better.)

								Let's be real. Having a mental illness sucks. I know because I was depressed for nine years and ended up droppping out of college because of it. I spent a lot of time meditating, contemplating the meaning of existence, and staring at my belly button before I figured out that a lot of the resources out there meant to help depression and anxiety didn't actually help me - but I did discover a few things that did. <br><br>

One day I decided to start a list of what I was doing that was helping, so when I had bad days in the future I would have a resource to go to.  Thus I started creating my Depression Toolbox, first as just a file on my computer and eventually it grew into what would later be Resilient. It expanded over time and eventually it was what I turned to for any depressive or anxious mood. Then I realized I could help a lot of people if I shared what I did to overcome my depression, so I created Resilient as a mental health app to share inspiration and tips for recovery.  And it's free.  Because regardless of who you are or what you have, you deserve to get help, and you deserve to be happy.<br><br>

									<p>
										Stop thinking about what society says you should do.  If you don't want to go to college, get married, buy a house with a white picket fence, work at a job you hate, and have 2.2 kids, then don't.  What do <em>you</em> want?  Do that instead.
