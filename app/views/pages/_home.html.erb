							<h1><strong>Can an app really make you happy?</strong></h1>
							<p class="lead">
								Well, no.  Here's the thing: happiness is an inside job.  So no app, hot boyfriend (or girlfriend), delicious food, new iPhone, big house, six figure job, nice car, or six pack abs are ever going to give you long-lasting happiness.  That's because happiness doesn't come from external validation, it comes from YOU.<br><br>

								Now you might be wondering what the point of making a mental health app is if it's not going to make you happy.  The point is to get you to see that happiness is a choice.  You don't have a choice in having a mental illness, but you do have a choice in whether or not you take the actions necessary to start getting better.  It's the hardest thing in the world, but choosing recovery will be the most worthwhile thing you ever do.<br><br>

								We want to help you out because there really are things you can do that make depression and anxiety a lot easier.  Life does NOT have to suck just because you have a mental illness.  You only get one life, so make this one amazing.  You deserve it, beautiful.<br><br>

								Let's be real. Having a mental illness is no walk in the park. I know because I was depressed for nine years and ended up droppping out of college because of it. I spent a lot of time meditating, contemplating the meaning of existence, and staring at my belly button before I realized that there wasn't really anywhere to go to find helpful resources for dealing with all of this.   It was like crossing an ocean without a map.  So I had to try out dozens of different things from many different sources over the course of more than a year before I figured out anything that was actually helpful.<br><br>

Eventually I figured out what did help and I started to recover.  My good days were more frequent and my bad days were farther apart.  I created a toolbox of resources for dealing with my depressive and anxious moods, everything from meditation to running to cutting out gluten and watching cat videos, and it actually worked.  Recovery is not a one time thing, though.  It's a choice you make every day to rise above your struggle, to say, "This illness does not define me."  And to keep trying.<br><br>

I created Resilient as a mental health app to share inspiration and tips for recovery.  And it's free.  Because regardless of who you are, you deserve to get help, and you deserve to be happy.  Really.<br><br>

										Stop thinking about what society says you should do.  If you don't want to go to college, get married, buy a house with a white picket fence, work at a job you hate, and have 2.2 kids, then don't.  What do <em>you</em> want?  Do that instead.
